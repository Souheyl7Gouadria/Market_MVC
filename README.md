## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### Design Patterns Implemented

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔄 **Repository Pattern** | Generic `IRepository<T>` providing consistent data access abstraction with expression-based filtering and eager loading support |
| 🎯 **Unit of Work Pattern** | Centralized transaction management through `IUnitOfWork`, ensuring atomic database operations with a single `Save()` method |
| 💉 **Dependency Injection** | All services registered via ASP.NET Core's built-in IoC container with scoped lifetime management |
| 🧩 **View Components** | Reusable, self-contained UI components (e.g., `CartItemViewComponent`) with their own logic and views |
| 📋 **ViewModel Pattern** | Strongly-typed view models (`ProductVM`, `OrderVM`, `RoleManagementVM`) for complex view data binding |
| ⚙️ **Options Pattern** | Typed configuration binding for external services (Stripe settings, Facebook OAuth) |
| 🏭 **Database Initializer** | Automatic database seeding and migration via `IDbInitializer` on application startup |
